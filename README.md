## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository!

I'm a full-stack developer passionate about building fast, responsive, and scalable web applications. My main stack includes React on the frontend, Node.js on the backend, and GraphQL for efficient data querying and communication between services. This space is where I share personal projects, experiments, and tools I've developed as part of my journey in web development.

With React, I focus on creating clean, component-based UIs that offer great user experiences. On the backend, I build APIs and services using Node.js, designing architectures that are both modular and performance-oriented. GraphQL has become a core part of my workflow, allowing me to craft flexible APIs that give clients exactly the data they needâ€”no more, no less.

Beyond the main stack, I also work with technologies like Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and various deployment platforms. I'm interested in best practices around authentication, state management, performance optimization, and clean code. I enjoy solving complex problems, designing intuitive features, and turning ideas into working products.

This repository includes full-stack project demos, boilerplate setups, and experiments with new tools and patterns. It serves not just as a portfolio, but also as a learning journalâ€”capturing my growth as a developer and my interest in staying current with modern web development trends.

Feel free to explore the projects, open issues, or contribute to anything that sparks your interest. I'm always excited to connect with other developers, exchange ideas, and collaborate on meaningful code.

Thanks for visitingâ€”and stay tuned for more updates, features, and experiments from the full-stack side of the web.
